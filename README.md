# Prosper's Loan Data Insights
## by Akalazu, Chidinma Stephanie


## Dataset

> This study made use of the Prosper loan dataset. This loan dataset has 113,937 loan observations and 81 columns/fields with names like interest rate, lender yield, borrower income, loan close date, borrower occupation, anticipated loss, loan tenure, investors, and many more. This dataset is available here, and you can get its data dictionaries here.

## Summary of Findings

>>> A moderately weak link exists between our variable of interest, the cost of borrowing, and the yield of the lender. Little to no association or relationship with the term exists. A rating from Prosper that demonstrates the higher loan length for the rating, the likely high cost of borrowing, and these B and D ratings, while other rating rating categories change and invert the cost of borrowing over the loan's term. While AA has the lowest borrower's cost (rate) for loans with terms of 12, 36, and 60 years, respectively, as can be seen in the above graph, lowest, lower, and low cost of borrowing are all characteristics of AA.

>>>> According to the C rating and the corresponding A, D, and B ratings, borrowing charges might not change depending on the size of the loan requested. Only E, AA, and HR had some flexibility in how much they could borrow and how much they would pay in borrowing fees. Although it seems that the majority of those who requested it chose $5,000 on average. The amount of the loan and the cost to the borrower also have a weak but negative relationship, as can be seen above. As would be expected, borrowers with higher Prosper ratings favor longer loan terms, such as 36 and 60 months, while borrowers with lower ratings are more likely to select shorter loan terms, such as 36 and 60 months.

>>>>> A higher rating does not always equate to a higher monthly income, despite the link between monthly revenue and rating that can be observed above. The reported monthly incomes of those with a D rating and 12-month terms appear to be higher than $12,000. A higher salary would allow one to pay off the loan as quickly as possible, therefore it seems sense that the majority of people who select the 12-month timeframe also tend to earn more money. This appears to be the choice of the majority of individuals looking for loans, and a marginally unfavorable association was shown. Contrary to lower terms, the bulk of borrowers favor loans of $5,000 to $25,000 in amount. The slope of the loan amount over the length of 60 months is steeper than the other two, indicating there is a negative association between the two. Most borrowers prefer loans between $5,000 and $25,000 as opposed to those with 12-month terms.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The important insights, as presented in the explanatory analysis, are as follows:

> Because borrowing costs are most noticeable between 0.05 and 0.385, the borrowing cost histogram is multimodal.

> In terms of loan seekers' preferences, the 36-month loan duration is preferred more than the other two (10 and 60 months) combined.

> More people have the employment status of credit consumer than any other type of employment combined.

> As it has almost no relationship with term and a very strong positive relationship with lender yield, borrowing cost has a weak yet negative association with loan and a very weak yet negative connection with monthly income.

> Monthly income raises the borrowing cost, according to the relationship between the borrowing cost and declared monthly income.

> Given the correlation between borrowing costs and reported monthly income, it stands to reason that as monthly income rises, borrowing costs should decrease.

> The association between the loan amount and the borrower's cost is adverse but not strong over the 12-month term. A moderately negative relationship seems to exist for the term of 36 months, and a strong negative relationship is indicated by the slope for the term of 60 months.

> In terms of lowest, lower, and lowest cost of borrowing, AA has the lowest borrower's cost (rate) for loans with terms of 12, 36, and 60 years, respectively.

> And A rating of Prosper, which both indicate that the longer the loan's term, the more likely it is that the cost of borrowing would be high, and B and D ratings.
